These are the files of the project made on the ["Advanced React & GraphQL"](https://advancedreact.com/) course by Wes Bos.

We will build "Sick Fits", a full stack online clothing store complete with real credit checkout. Users can search, sell, add to cart and checkout their favourite items.

The application has six main models — Users, Items, Orders, CartItems, OrderItems, and Roles — all of which are relational and showcase the power of relational GraphQL Queries.

The app also includes many server side bits including authentication, permissions, sending email, uploading images, and charging credit cards.

In addition to building both the frontend and backend of the application, we also spend the last section of the course Testing the React application.

## Tech stack used: Next JS, Jest, GraphQL, Apollo Client, KeystoneJS, Styled Components
